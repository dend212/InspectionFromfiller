# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Field techs capture inspection data digitally on-site, and the office produces a professional, pixel-perfect ADEQ inspection report without manually re-entering data into a PDF.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from 19 v1 requirements. PDF generation isolated as Phase 3 (highest risk).
- Roadmap: Media capture (MDIA-01, MDIA-02) grouped with form input; media embedding (MDIA-03) grouped with PDF generation.
- Roadmap: Workiz integration remains v2 -- app is fully functional with manual data entry.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (PDF Generation): Highest-risk technical work. Mapping 100+ fields across 7 ADEQ pages to pdfme x/y coordinates is significant effort. pdfme WYSIWYG Designer should help.
- Phase 3: Photo embedding file size in multi-page PDFs needs validation during execution.
